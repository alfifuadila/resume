                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>As a curious and collaborative person, I am interested in pursuing a career as a data analyst.
                    To find out how data analysis should be, I am currently doing a remote postgraduate program 
                    focusing on business analytics in ITS. Sharpen my skills through analytical projects according 
                    to the business problems involved by enrolling in a 12-week data analytics program in RevoU 
                    and I am able to use data processing tools such as SQL, Python, Looker Studio and Tableau. 
                    With the skills and experiences mentioned, problem solving ability and good communication, 
                    I am eager to further enhance my skills and give more value to data analytics works.</p>
